Emilio Kartono (kartonoe)

Phase 1

- Created classes used to represent the Picture and the Tags
- Created a PictureManager (an observer) that will observe any changes in the mappings / tags / pictures, and performs IO changes to accomodate those
- Created the Command manager and its associated Command classes used to undo / redo actions the user has done in the GUI (such as undoing a name change)
- Helped incorporate together the gui and backend by contribituing to the controller and debugging along the way

Phase 2
- Constructed the Gantt chart so that team members and I get their deliverables done on time.
- Constructed the Slideshow window in the GUI side of the application and with Shimi, it was converted to FXML.
- Refactored code in the backend (such as removing redundent functions).
- Rewrote the javadocs in the backend.
- Added the feature in the backend where there is a pool of tags in the PictureManager and each picture will get tags from.
