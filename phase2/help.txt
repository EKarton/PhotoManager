For Unix shell users: We made a shell script to compile/run the program,

Go to the directory of the project
Ex:  /././group_0493/phase1
Then run the following command
sh compile.sh


Note, the following are ome operations we do not permit:

1. If a picture's name is illegal, for example 1. "@abc" (nothing before @), "@" (a single @)
2. An empty Tag cannot be added.
3. A tag with space cannot be added.
4. A tag with "@" cannot be added.
