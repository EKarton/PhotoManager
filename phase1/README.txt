For Unix shell users: We made a shell script to compile/run the program,

all you have to do so go to the directory of the project
Ex:  /././group_0493/phase1
Then do type in the following in the command
sh compile.sh


Guidance for users:

1. If a picture's name is illegal, for example 1. "@abc" (nothing before @), "@" (a single @)

2. An empty Tag cannot be added.

3. A tag with space cannot be added.

4. A tag with "@" cannot be added.
